Setting Permanent Aliases for Windows PowerShell or Terminal
So you recently moved back to windows or have sarted developing on windows and 
encountered the long git commands which you'd like to shorten, don't worry, why? Because I gatchu my friend.

## Aliases in Windows ##
To check if we can create an alias in PowerShell, letâ€™s try this command:

`g --version`
Note: This alias will be gone when we restart (reopen) PowerShell, since it is not permanent yet.
