# powershell_aliases_for_git
So you recently moved back to windows or have sarted developing on windows and 
encountered the long git commands which you'd like to shorten, don't worry, why? Because I gatchu my friend.
In Windows, setting aliases and making them permanent are a little bit trickier than Linux.
## Aliases in Windows ##
To check if we can create an alias in PowerShell, letâ€™s try this command:
`New-Alias -Name g -Value git`
Using our new alias g, we can see the git version with command:
`g --version`
Note: This alias will be gone when we restart (reopen) PowerShell, since it is not permanent yet.
## Making Aliases Permanent in Windows ##
In order to make our aliases permanent, we should first find the location of the profile file of PowerShell, by typing:
`echo $profile`
Response will be something similar to this:
`C:\Users\user\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
